## 🚀 How It Works

### **For Match Organizers:**

#### **Accessing Edit Mode:**
1. Go to your match details page
2. Click the blue **"Edit Match"** button (only visible to organizers)
3. Edit form opens with current data pre-populated

#### **What You Can Edit:**
- ✅ **Match Title** - Change the name/description
- ✅ **Date & Time** - Reschedule the match
- ✅ **Pitch Type** - Switch between 5-a-side, 7-a-side, 11-a-side
- ✅ **Location** - Use full map picker to change venue
- ✅ **Pricing** - Update cost per player
- ✅ **Max Players** - Increase/decrease capacity (min = current players)
- ✅ **Notes** - Add or modify additional information

#### **Smart Features:**
- **Current Player Protection**: Can't reduce max players below current participants
- **Form Validation**: All original validation rules apply
- **Location Memory**: Map remembers current location when editing
- **Cancel Option**: Can cancel changes and return to match details

### **For Match Participants:**

#### **Automatic Notifications:**
When an organizer updates match details, participants receive notifications like:

- 📧 **"Match Details Updated"**
- 📧 **"The date changed to March 15, 2024"**
- 📧 **"The time changed to 3:00 PM and location changed to 'Central Park Field 3'"**
- 📧 **"Multiple details were updated: title changed to 'Weekend Football', price changed to £8"**

#### **Notification Features:**
- 🔔 **Bell Icon Badge** - Shows unread count
- 📱 **Dropdown Access** - Quick view in notification center  
- 🖱️ **Click to View** - Links directly to updated match
- ✅ **Mark as Read** - Individual or bulk mark as read
- 📄 **Full Page** - Complete notification management at `/notifications`

## 🎯 **Smart Change Detection**

The system intelligently detects what changed and creates appropriate messages:

### **Single Changes:**
- `"The date changed to March 15, 2024"`
- `"The location changed to 'Riverside Football Ground'"`
- `"The price changed to £12"`

### **Multiple Changes:**
- `"The date changed to March 15, 2024 and time changed to 3:00 PM"`
- `"Multiple details were updated: title changed to 'Championship Match', max players changed to 18, additional notes updated"`

### **What Doesn't Trigger Notifications:**
- ⚪ **Player Count Changes** - Automatic updates from joins/leaves don't spam notifications
- ⚪ **Minor Updates** - Internal system changes don't notify participants
- ⚪ **Organizer Actions** - The organizer who made changes doesn't get notified

## 🔧 **Technical Implementation**

### **Database Trigger Logic:**
```sql
-- Detects changes and builds notification messages
IF OLD.title != NEW.title THEN
  changes_array := array_append(changes_array, 'title changed to "' || NEW.title || '"');
END IF;

-- Notifies all participants except organizer
FOR participant_record IN 
  SELECT DISTINCT mp.user_id 
  FROM match_participants mp 
  WHERE mp.match_id = NEW.id 
  AND mp.user_id != NEW.organizer_id
```

### **UI Flow:**
```
Organizer → Match Details → Edit Match → Make Changes → Save
     ↓
Database Trigger Detects Changes
     ↓
Notifications Created for All Participants
     ↓
Participants See Bell Icon → Read Notification → View Match
```

## 📱 **User Experience Examples**

### **Scenario 1: Date Change**
1. **Organizer**: Changes match from Saturday to Sunday
2. **System**: Detects date change automatically  
3. **Participants**: Get notification: *"Match Details Updated: The date changed to Sunday, March 17, 2024. Please check the updated details."*
4. **Result**: Everyone knows about the reschedule immediately

### **Scenario 2: Venue Change**
1. **Organizer**: Updates location using map picker
2. **System**: Detects location and coordinates change
3. **Participants**: Get notification: *"Match Details Updated: The location changed to 'Westfield Sports Complex'. Please check the updated details."*
4. **Result**: No one shows up at the wrong location

### **Scenario 3: Multiple Updates**
1. **Organizer**: Changes time, price, and max players
2. **System**: Combines all changes into one notification
3. **Participants**: Get notification: *"Match Details Updated: Multiple details were updated: time changed to 2:00 PM, price changed to £10, max players changed to 20. Please check the updated details."*
4. **Result**: Single notification covers all changes, not spam
