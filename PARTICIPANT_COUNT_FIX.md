# Participant Count Fix

## Issue
When users joined matches created by others, the participant count displayed as 1/22 instead of updating to 2/22.

## Root Cause
The application was relying on a database trigger (`update_match_player_count()`) to automatically update the `current_players` field in the `matches` table. This trigger was either:
1. Not working properly
2. Had timing issues with the UI refresh
3. Not executing consistently

## Solution
Updated the application to calculate participant counts dynamically from the actual `match_participants` table data instead of relying on the database trigger.

### Changes Made

#### 1. Match Details Page (`src/app/matches/[id]/page.tsx`)
- **`fetchMatchDetails()`**: Now queries `match_participants` table to get accurate count
- **`handleJoinMatch()`**: Added optimistic UI updates for immediate feedback
- **`handleLeaveMatch()`**: Added optimistic UI updates with error rollback

#### 2. Matches List Page (`src/app/matches/page.tsx`)
- **`fetchMatches()`**: Bulk queries all participant counts and maps them to matches
- Ensures consistent counts across the matches listing

#### 3. Dashboard Page (`src/app/dashboard/page.tsx`)
- **`fetchUserMatches()`**: Updated to get accurate counts for both created and joined matches
- Maintains data consistency across user dashboard

### Key Features
1. **Optimistic Updates**: UI updates immediately when joining/leaving for better UX
2. **Error Rollback**: If join/leave fails, the optimistic update is reverted
3. **Accurate Counts**: Always uses actual database count, not cached values
4. **Bulk Operations**: Efficient querying to avoid N+1 problems

### Testing
1. Create a match with one account
2. Join the match with a different account
3. Verify count updates from 1/X to 2/X immediately
4. Refresh the page to confirm the count persists
5. Leave the match and verify count decreases

### Database Note
The original database trigger can remain in place as a backup, but the application no longer depends on it for accurate counts.

## Benefits
- ✅ Immediate UI feedback when joining/leaving matches
- ✅ Consistent participant counts across all pages
- ✅ No dependency on database triggers
- ✅ Better error handling and user experience
